# Industria Create Mod

## Overview
Industria Create is a Minecraft mod that extends the Create mod by adding industrial workers (based on villagers) that can operate machinery, transport items, and work in assigned areas. This mod introduces a layer of human-managed automation to the Create mod's mechanical systems.

## Features
- **Worker Villagers**: Custom entities that can be assigned tasks and work zones
- **Task System**: Assign transport, machine operation, and mechanism activation tasks to workers
- **Zone Markers**: Define work areas for your industrial workers
- **Worker Whistle**: Tool to assign tasks to workers by selecting them and then their target

## How to Use

### Worker Villagers
Worker villagers are special entities that can perform tasks for you. They have:
- **Motivation**: Affects their work speed and efficiency
- **Energy**: Determines how long they can work before needing rest
- **Tasks**: What they're currently doing

To check a worker's status, right-click them with an empty hand.

### Worker Whistle
The worker whistle is used to assign tasks to workers:
1. Craft a worker whistle
2. Right-click on a worker to select them
3. Right-click on a target block to assign a task
4. The worker will move to the target and perform the appropriate task

To cancel a task assignment, right-click in the air with the whistle.

### Zone Markers
Zone markers define work areas for your workers:
1. Place zone markers to define the boundaries of a work area
2. Workers assigned to that zone will stay within its boundaries

## Development Status
This mod is currently in Phase 1 of development, which includes:
- Basic worker villager entity
